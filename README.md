## üíº Featured Projects

### Freelance Consulting Project -- Analyzing Support Chat Agent Performance:
As a freelance data scientist, I conducted an in-depth analysis of over 350,000 customer support chat interactions for an online custom printing company. The project focused on identifying key trends in chat frequency, agent response times, common customer queries, and sentiment shifts throughout conversations to gauge support quality. Using pre-trained models like BERTopic and roBERTa, I extracted insights into customer satisfaction and agent performance. The analysis uncovered areas for improvement in customer service and highlighted actionable insights for enhancing the overall support experience.

#### Top 25 Topics from Initial Customer Messages Using BERTopic
| Topic | Count | topic_name | top_terms |
|-------|-------|------------|-----------|
| 0     | 4581  | status     | ['status', 'orders', 'order', 'ordered'] |
| 1     | 885   | coupon     | ['coupon', 'coupons', 'discount', 'promo', 'discounts', 'promos', 'code', 'codes'] |
| 2     | 782   | cancel     | ['cancel', 'cancellation', 'orders', 'order', 'cancelled', 'canceled'] |
| 3     | 757   | shipping   | ['shipping', 'free', 'ship', 'freight', 'fedex', 'cost', 'costs'] |
| 4     | 731   | exempt     | ['exempt', 'exemption', 'exemptions', 'tax', 'taxes', 'taxexempt'] |
| 5     | 671   | quotes     | ['quotes', 'quote', 'quotation'] |
| 6     | 587   | sku        | ['sku', 'looking'] |

### Sentiment Analysis on Enron Emails:
Developed a fine-tuned BERT model to classify the sentiment of over 1,000 manually annotated Enron emails, significantly outperforming a baseline Naive Bayes classifier. This model was then applied to 144,000 additional emails to analyze sentiment trends during the Enron scandal.

### Ghosted -- Python Library for Synthetic Data Generation and Tuning
Ghosted is a Python library I developed for generating synthetic data, augmenting existing datasets, and visualizing complex data distributions. It‚Äôs designed for other data scientists, researchers, and developers who need to generate realistic synthetic data or blend synthetic data with real data for privacy-preserving applications, prototyping, testing, and educational purposes.
