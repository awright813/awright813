## üíº Featured Projects
### Sentiment Analysis on Enron Emails:
Developed a fine-tuned BERT model to classify the sentiment of over 1,000 manually annotated Enron emails, significantly outperforming a baseline Naive Bayes classifier. This model was then applied to 144,000 additional emails to analyze sentiment trends during the Enron scandal.
